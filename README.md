- We inspired from the US Health Care System, and how their patient and Doctors interact and give their services and we present you a system that helps to mrpove that system between Patient and Provider.
- We have noticed a lack of interaction between the Patient with Provider(Doctor)
- There are lots of fraudulen claims done by provider to the Payer(Insurance Company) to reduce the
- We made this portal to give a smooth connection between the Patient <-> Provider <-> Payer
- Through our platform the Payer comapny can regulate the smooth functioning between the Provider and Patient
- Doctors can have a full patient medical history and can provide better services
