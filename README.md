# CureHub

## üí° Inspiration
- Many times, during the case of emergency, it is difficult for doctors to find previous diagnosis and diseases of a patient, and therefore it is difficult to prescribe a perfect treatment for a patient. Then we came up with a solution what if every medical related issues, diagnosis, prescription, indications are found in one place, it will be easier. 
- We inspired from the US Health Care System, and how their patient and Doctors interact and give their services and we present you a system that helps to mrpove that system between Patient and Provider.
- We have noticed a lack of interaction between the Patient with Provider(Doctor)
- There are lots of fraudulen claims done by provider to the Payer(Insurance Company) to reduce the
- We made this portal to give a smooth connection between the Patient <-> Provider <-> Payer
 

## üíª What it does
- Through our platform the Payer company can regulate the smooth functioning between the Provider and Patient
- Doctors can have a full patient medical history so he can decide the best treatment without any hassle. 
- Treatment transparency between insurence provider, doctor, hospital.
- Current Doctor can contact the previous doctor of the patient to resolve any doubts regarding the previous diagnosis.
- We encrypted all the sensitive information transferred to and fro the server to make the system secure using 128 bit encryption.
- gives the complete information of most disease in the region, country. so that the authorities can do the best to control it.
- Hospital can see the frequency of diseases treated in their hospital, with the age of patient, so they can craft their helathcare system for the best possible care of their patient.
- No paper required methodology.
- Here types of user that can interact-
  - Patient
  - Doctor
  - Hospital 
  - Payer (Insurace company)
  - Diagnosis Center

## üî® How we built it
- Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, Javascript
- backend: Django
- Database: SQLite3
- Encryption/Decryption: MATLAB
- Server: WSGI server


## üß† Challenges we ran into
- Integrating the encryption algorithm
- making the server robust 
- Completing the project in 48 hours

## How we use MATLAB
- We used matlab for implementing the encryption-decryption, which is further connected by python by an API.

## How we used Github
- Github helped in managing the flow of this project, like creating issues which helpd us in tracking the progress. and the project feature of Github helped in the complete management and its automation
- By opening the pull request, the whole team can test the new code without hampering the current enviornment and if the code was successfull, we can smoothly compare our code and merge it into the main branch.

## üèÖ Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Creating and digital medical system.
- Awesome Team work.


## üìñ What we learned
- We learned about the possible improvent in the healthcare system, which can be smoothened, transparent, robust, and more secure.


## üöÄ What's next for CureHub
- This applicaton is most successful when government controls it, Compulsarize all its citizen.
- Making the whole system decentralized, making it more secure. hash all the database details, so that the sensitive details of patient can't be hacked
- we are working on the access mechanism, so that whoever try to access the details of patient, ask for their permissions first. In case of emergency or patient age less then 18, their backup contact can grant the access.
